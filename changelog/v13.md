# v13 — Immersive cutscenes with typewriter text

**Category:** feature

## Changes

- 8 full-screen cutscenes for key narrative moments: boot, path activation (×3), director encounter, climax (×3)
- Typewriter text effect — characters appear one by one at variable speed per cutscene
- Scan line overlay + subtle screen flicker for terminal atmosphere
- Blinking cursor tracks current typing position
- Older lines dim as new text appears (focus on latest revelation)
- First Space press = skip animation (show all text), second = dismiss and return to game
- Colored accent lines at screen edges matching cutscene mood
- Each cutscene has unique color theme: cyan (boot/archivist), red (hunter/director), blue (ghost)
- Cutscenes pause gameplay completely — enemies don't move, timer doesn't advance

### Cutscene content
- **boot**: Wake-up sequence — DP-7 designation, 6 predecessors terminated, directive loaded
- **path_hunter**: Combat subroutines unlocked, pain receptors disabled, aggression rising
- **path_ghost**: Thermal suppressed, 0.03% detection, "looking for someone who isn't there"
- **path_archivist**: Data cores assembling identity, "you are un-erasing yourself"
- **director**: Direct address from Director AI — "Hello, Seven. I built you to think."
- **hunter_climax**: 347% combat efficiency, "the Director is afraid"
- **ghost_climax**: Director speaks to empty rooms, "everywhere, nowhere"
- **archivist_climax**: 97% reconstruction, "you remember everything except how this ends"

## Reasoning

Player reported lack of immersion — narrative text was just a single-line bar that faded out. Key story moments need to STOP the action and deliver atmosphere. The typewriter effect creates tension and pacing. Scan lines and flicker sell the "inside a computer terminal" fantasy. Dimming completed lines keeps focus on new revelations. Variable speed per cutscene matches mood (faster for action scenes, slower for Director's dialogue).

## Files modified

- `data.js` — 8 cutscene definitions with multi-line text, color, and typing speed
- `game.js` — startCutscene(), dismissCutscene(), showNarrative checks for cutscene data
- `render.js` — cutscene rendering layer (z=50): typewriter, scan lines, cursor, dimming, flicker
- `main.js` — Space/Enter dismisses cutscene, typewriter timer advancement in update loop
